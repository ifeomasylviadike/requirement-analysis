# requirement-analysis

The goal of this project is to help professional developers improve their skills in analyzing software requirements. It focuses on creating clear, structured documentation, identifying both functional and non-functional needs, using tools like Draw.io for visualizing systems, setting clear acceptance criteria, and following industry best practices for producing high-quality documentation and diagrams.


What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting what a software system should do.
- It ensures clarity and understanding.
- It helps define scope.
- It reduces rework and errors.
- It improves communication.
- It enables better design and development.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- It builds the foundation for project success.
- It aligns stakeholders.
- It minimizes costly errors.
- It improves product quality.
- It supports better planning & estimation.
- It drives user satisfaction.
- It enables effective testing.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- Requirement Gathering: 
Talking to stakeholders (users, business leaders, clients) through interviews, surveys, workshops, etc., to understand their needs.

- Requirement Categorization: 
Functional Requirements – What the system should do (features, behaviors)
Non-Functional Requirements – How the system should perform (speed, reliability, scalability).

- Requirement Prioritization: 
Distinguishing between "must-haves," "nice-to-haves," and "can-wait" features to align with project goals and timelines.

- Modeling and Visualization: 
Creating diagrams like flowcharts, wireframes, and data models (e.g., using tools like Draw.io) to visually represent system workflows and architecture.

- Documentation:
Writing clear, concise documents such as:
Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
User stories
Use cases
Acceptance criteria

- Validation and Verification:
Confirming with stakeholders that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with business objectives.

Types of Requirements:
Functional Requirements – What the system should do (features, behaviors)
- User Authentication & Profile Management
- Hotel & Room Listings
- Search & Filtering
- Booking & Reservation Management
- Payment Processing
- Reviews & Ratings
- Notifications & Alerts
- Admin Dashboard

Non-Functional Requirements – How the system should perform (speed, reliability, scalability)
- Performance & Latency
- Scalability & Availability
- Data consistency & Reliability
- Security & Compliance
- Usability & Accessibility
- Maintainability & Fault tolerance
